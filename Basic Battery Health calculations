# Symptoms have included "being slow" and "shutting down in the middle of something". The fun begins!

First I updated the MacBook terminal to the new "zsh" with the following command:
    chsh -s /bin/zsh
# Nice and easy so far.

Input the following command to check out the various capacities: ioreg -l -wO | grep Capacity

A number of stats will be displayed, the following being relevant to our problem:

  Design Capacity represents 100% (7150 in my case)
  Max Capacity represents Battery Health (6295 in my case)
  The simple math is (Max Capacity x 100)/Design Capacity
  (6295 x 100)/7150 = 88.042% 
  The delta between Max Capacity and 100% is your Current battery health state (11.958% reduced)
  
  Next step is to determine the Battery Cycle Count
  
  # I have never used Apple products - so this required some sleuthing and GoogleWork
  
  While holding the Option Button down, click on the Apple Icon at the top left of the screen
  While STILL holding the Option Button down, click on System Information
  Open up the Hardware Section if not already displayed
  Scroll down to Power where you'll see Battery Informaiton and System Power Settings displayed
  
  In the Battery Information view Cycle Count under the Health Information sub-section.
  # This one is 522
  # I was told the MacBook Air has somewhere between 500-800 cycles in its' battery life. 
  # That said - my other MacBook Air (2015) has 2000 cycles! Although it shuts down arbitrarily and can't 
  # survive away from the power supply for any length of time and probably should have been upgraded a few cycles ago ;-)
  
  Having a quick look into things, I decided it best to roll back from the resource intensive Monteray OS to a previous version that
  is much lighter and see if things speed up. 
  
  # I rolled it back to 10.15.7 which is Catolina. 
  # The computer now works better than ever. 
  Go into System Preferences and ensure the OS does NOT get updated. 
  
  # Ensure the other options remain enforced to update security features of Catolina as well the various application updates that will keep you safe out there.
